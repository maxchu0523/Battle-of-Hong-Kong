## Project Description

This was a website about the Battle Of Hong Kong in WWII [Battle of Hong Kong Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hong_Kong). 
Being born and raised in Hong Kong, I created this website to commemorate those who sacrificed in protecting Hong Kong. It was also part of my coursework for the Professional Certificate in Information and Interface Design i pursued at the Hong Kong Design Institute.

## Highlighted Features

- There was an interactive infographic describing the progression of the battle. When users scrolled down the timeline, the map on the left-hand side would change accordingly. The calculation logic was implemented in `src/pages/Main.tsx` in the `handleScroll` function. It calculated the midpoint of the window and updated the map accordingly.

## Installation
This is a standard React app. Please follow the link below for the React installation guide: [React Installation Guide](ReactREADME.md)


## Thank You 
I would like to express my gratitude to course lecturer Marcelo. I wouldn't have been able to complete the infographic without his help.
